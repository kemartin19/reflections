When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository is useful when working with a group on a file/program. It is also helpful if you plan on
working on the file/program from a different computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For the same reasons that you would want to make your commits on your machine manually rather than automatically.
Having Git automatically pull every change made on GitHub could pull changes that aren't ready/functioning, and it
does not make sense to pull every tiny change made to a file/program.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Within one repository, you can create a branch of commits in order to test out code, etc. In order to move your
repository to GitHub, or from GitHub to your machine, you can create a clone of your tree. Finally, forks are a 
GitHub-only method of essentially cloning someone else's code/files in order for you to be able to make changes
without changing their original files(s).
