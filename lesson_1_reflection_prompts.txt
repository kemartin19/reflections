How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Viewing a diff between two versions of a file was easier than searching manually for the
differences because the program pinpointed the exact sections where the differences occurred.
I no longer had to scan the entire file for differences because the computer did it for me.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you are able to see the different revisions made to a file, then studying these revisions
could possibly help you to skip over certain steps when programming something similar in the
future. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you doin Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

One pro is that you can choose logical points to create a commit that make more sense than if the commits were done automatically. A con of this is that one could forget to make a commit, which would not be possible if they were being done automatically.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one
commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In some instances, when we are working on multiple files that are all somehow related, it makes
sense to save all these files in one commit. However, when the files are not dependent on or
related to each other, then treating each file separately makes more sense.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows me the history of every commit made to a file. git diff allows me to then compare
two of those commits to see what exactly was changed from the first one to the second.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break
something?

If I break something I know that I can always just go back to the previous commit and start over.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control of different programs.
