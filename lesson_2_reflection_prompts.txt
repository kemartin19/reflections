What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initilialize a repository, it does not create any commits. However, you now
have the ability to create commits for the files in the same directory as the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where your files go when you decide to create a commit. These files
are initially in the same working directory as the repository, and are sent to the staging
area as a sort of intermediate space before the commit is created.
